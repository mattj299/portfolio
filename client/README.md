## Project use

This is my portfolio built from scratch. It was built from scratch to showcase not only my other projects but this is a project website itself. It shows my work from production to code on github. As well as links to my socials and a contact page.

"npm run deploy" to redeploy site
don't forget push to master to show your code

<!--
if you want, build something that actually can do something for a cause, or just do this.

regardless what you decide actually focus on the look of this site. all your sites have the functionality but look like shit.
ik you're not a designer but come on it looks like shit every fucking time dude como que si no tienes idea.

after create site based on you and being able to be a personal trainer, nutritionist, or some shit like that

AFTER COMPLETELY DONE WITH SITE

go back to MERN stack application and change the loading. looks stupid and unprofessional when saying 'either loading or no posts'
figure out how to either have it loading or have no posts separately not together

create one advertising your "personal training" or "nutrition" whatever you want or both but something about you or sometihng that's actually fucking useful and not just little projects that don't necessarily do anything for you but simply add projects to your fucking repository which look like shit btw just wanted to add that.

IDEA

go on dribble and copy a design for your own site first just copy the straight design as well as word for word and color for color but once done
take a design and make a website yourself but using only their design
